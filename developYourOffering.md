## Develope your own offering:
I just got off the phone with that young consultant that I have been advising. He is in an interesting condrum.

He has yet to define a specific list of services he offers. So inevitablyy clients have come to him requesting various services that he is interested in offering but are not really within his core compitency. Far worse then that they are 



## What is the problem://NOTE: These seem extream
Imagine that you are a painter that specializes in landscapes and you spent your whole life working to be the best at painting landskapes. You might have played around with painting people's portrates or two but haven't really done much with that. Then a client comes in and says you are a great painter but instead of buying one of the paintings of a landskape you have already done they try and comission you to do a portrate for them.


Recently one of my engineer friends who is considered a technical expert in a specific field was approched to do business development in that field. Though he was known in the field as an expert technician he had no expirence doing business development. It was a little humiours to watch this company struggle to aquwardly close this deal with him as a biz dev considering they were hiring him to close deals on their behalf. 

He didn't want to get into the biz dev field really, he just failed to define his offerings and so the client made up their own request. 


## What is an offering:
An offering is a specific service your consultancy offers. More then that it is the terms and pricing on which you offer it.

Imagine you offer to write content for a potential client's blog? Cool. Its that simple, right? Client gives you money and you give the client content?


- Are you allowed to put your name on it or is it white labeled?
- Who gets final say on the topics of the content you are providing?
- How often will you deliver the content?
- How long are the posts you are delivering?
- How are you charing for it? Hourly/Per Word? Per Post? Retiner?
- How many revisions are included with your fee?
- Are you offering to promote it on your own networks as well?
- Is this the only contract you will be working on or will you be free to work on others?
- Does the client own all intelectual property you produce while on the contract or just posts specific to them?
- Legally are you assigning ownership of the content to the client or just licencing it to them? 


All these questions need to be answered and more. 


#### The hidden costs of negiotating:
If every time you enter into a new engagment with a new client or existing you have to negiotiate each and everyone one of these points then you will waste a lot of time and energy just working out the details of the engagment. This might be good if the value of the contract is in the 7 figures, then you could pay a business development and a lawyer guy to work through this for each contract. But more than likely the value of your contracts starting out are going to be much less. That means the costs to you of negotiating these details is significantly higher in proportion to the profit you will turn. 

#### What if we just ignore these details and just see what the client wants?

### Types of potential clients:

#### Un-educated cleints with no terms:
Some clients wont know a ribeye from a flank steak.
They might be inetereted in comissioning a painting but don't know an abstract paiting from a realisim portrate.
In tech I encounter these all of the time:
 "Oh you specialize in desiging large scale IoT applications that run on a virtualized linux backend on AWS? Does that mean you can help me troubleshoot some issue on my personal Windows PC?"
If I had not clearly deifined my offerings then I might fall into conversations like that which go in circles and cause me headache after headache. Fortunatly I know what my consultancy's expertice is.


They don't have any specific agenda but they know they need some help. They come to you with a problem but no real idea of what the solution is. 

These kinds of clients need a lot of help educating themselves.

If the solution to their problem falls within your sphear of expirtice and you want to do business with them then YOU will be responsable for educating them. 

You will want to build this into your services and factor it into your costs. 
- Marketing costs (Education before a contract is signed and money changes hands) vs service costs

#### Educated clients with a terms:
Other clients may know exactly what they need, --they even know how they want it delivered and how much they are willing to pay for it--. 

Beyond that they even know the terms they want. Unfortunatly the terms they want may not always be in your best interest. 
Some examples of terms that conflict with your best interest are as follows:

- They might want to hire you exclusivly, but unfortunatly this means that you would have to drop your other clients and lose out on that revinue.
- They might put in clauses to own any and all intelectual property you create while on the contract. This means that you cannot use any IP or ideas that come up from the contract for your other projects.
- They might require for you to white lable all deliverables meaning that you cannot use the contract to showcase your work forgoing a valuable marketing tool for your business.
- They might want payment terms that leave you waiting a long time for the client to pay leaving you hurting for cash in the mean time.

Any if not all of these things are not in your best interest.



#### Educated clients that match your terms:
These are the clients you want. 
Great clients are not born(they dont just stuble into your office) they are taught/trained

These client can be created by taking an uneducated client and educating them or by taking an educated client with their own terms and convincing them to accept your terms. 

Either way these are the clients you want.




## The solution - present your own offering:

Decide what you are going to offer to your clients and how. 
Eductate your potential clients on your offerings and terms by drafting marketing materials that clearly state both. 
Take a few more minutes upfront to clearly state your offering. Clarifying this communication









### Set your offering:
Decide exactly what it is your offering. 
Is it branding or graphic design? Some clients dont know?

What is the end deliverable?

#### Niche is big:

Wordpress vs Facebook:




! You cant be an expert in everything !
- Designers expected to be marketing experts

At my company we had very specific offerings that only delt with a very specific type of technology. This allowed me and my staff to focus on a ver

This doesnt mean that if a client or potential had a request for a periferial services we would tell them to take a hike. It just means that we would opt to refer the client to another trusted service providor that did specialize in the clients needs instead of us ham-handedly trying to fulfill the client's request that was out side our sphere of expertice.
For the example of the markering expert that recived design requests I would definitly get networked in and find a couple designers that I trust and could refer the client to or sub-contract.


#### Does this mean I can't change my offerings?

Drastic example: Facebook -> AWS -> Machine Learning

- Offerings might suck



#### Figuring out your offerings:
Me and facebook - 
-> Service - Not scalable
-> Product - Loosing money
-> Productized Service - $$$ (for a while)
----> Problem: Seasonal

Me and AWS:
-> Service - Building shit
-> Productized Service - AWS Managment -> $$$$
----> Problem: People :P

















### Set your terms:
Sometimes(quite often actually) you might agree on the service but not the terms. 

- Intelectual Property
- Payment Terms - Cashflow Positive
- Non-competes - 
- Whitelabeling - Charge extra
- When and where you provide services
- Who works on the project?



#### Variables for market positioning:
Shoud be stead fast on all of these points and never budge?

No, not neccissarily. Its all market positioning. 

I offten let clients whitelabel our work, which means I can't showcase the project on my consultancys marketing materials. In exchange for me giving up such a valuable marketing oppertunity I price the work so the client to compensates us financially for the oppertunity loss. 

It's all about how you want to position yourself in the market. You can make a great business offering the exact same deliverables under different terms.

There are great businesses that offer the same as their competitors down the street but they offer net 90 terms instead of net 30 giving the client more time before their tab is due.

Other content business offer a discount to clients so that instead of giving the client exclusive ownership of content created while on the contract the consultants can re-licence that content to other clients after a certain period.

Think of these terms as variables that you can tweak to better position your business and optimize how your business runs.






#### Exclusivity:
What is the point of having your own business if it is absolutly dependant on you to fulfill every task. 
That model will never scale.


Some might ask to know what else your working on. 



##### Its like owning a resteraunt:
You as the resteruant owner might brag that someone famous ate at your resteraunt yesterday but if a resteraunt patron asked you for a complete list of everyone that ate at your resteraunt over the last 10 days you would never give them that information.


#### When and where you provide your services:

#### The right to sub-contract/employ:
Resteraunt vs private chef - 

Resteraunt owners have a much larger earning potential but the private chef takes on less risk. You have to figure out what fits your busness the best.

Partners - 


#### Supply and demand:
