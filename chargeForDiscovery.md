Consulting - Discovery

Recently a young aspiring crypto professional reached out to me to ask for advice on how to run a successful consulting business. I figured why not spare him the painful lessons I learned. Then I decided to take it a step further and share these lessons with the rest of the world so I decided to start writing.

## Enter the Discovery Period:
If you are in the business of creating custom solutions for clients (consulting), before you can start working on a project you need to figure out exactly what the custom solution you are building is and how it fits into any of the client’s existing systems.

You sit down with the client and start hashing out what is to be built. Once you know what is to be built, you create an estimate of cost. All of this takes a fair amount of time and effort.

## Problem: Window Shoppers:
When I was a younger, more nieve consultant I worked with a small marketing agency out of Chicago that shall remain nameless. They would come to me with a project and ask me to do discovery which would give them an estimate of hours and a technical break down.

I didn’t get paid for this discovery period because I looked at it as a marketing or sales expense that was just a cost of doing business. I would spend hours and hours of my own time on the discovery period studying the user stories, researching options and putting together a dazzling proposal.

This is all well and good except the agency would then take that proposal and use it to bargain against other potential consultants like myself. Sometimes I would get the contract, sometimes I would not.  This is what I like to call **“Window Shopping”** and it is costly and painful for you, the consultant.

Large established companies with a solid business model, predictable numbers, and a bunch of cash in the bank might be able to take on these costs but as a consultant just starting out I would not recommend you take on these costs. Don’t worry there is a simple way.

## Solution: Get Paid for Discovery:
To combat Window Shoppers I simply started charging for discovery with a new service I termed my “Strategic Assessment”. This new service allowed the client to retain my services for a 2 week discovery period at the end of which I would deliver a presentation and report on my findings that outlined everything they would find in a discovery period and a lot more.

I billed for every second of my time and basically got paid to draft the Statement Of Work for a larger, more lucrative contract.  The client got a hell of a report that they could then use to shop around to as many vendors as they wanted to.

Did it bother me that they shopped around with the report I had put all that effort into? Hell no, I got paid. Also it never happened. Why would they shop around too much if they already had a fully qualified consultant capable of carrying out the contract already engaged and working for them?

It is the puppy dog sales approach. If in those 2 weeks I did not wow the hell out of them they could go with another vender and cut their losses. On the flip side if I didn’t like the client I could walk too but that would be a little bit awkward.

## Deliverables and SOW:
The deliverables are simple:

- 1 report
- 1 presentation

It is that simple. As far as what should be in the report that will depend on you and your industry. I suggest looking at previous project scopes and estimates then find other ways to add value beyond what you have in the past. If you’re charging for discovery it should have a little extra zing in it for the client. It will help you stand out in a crowd.

If you are real smart, once you get a few assessments under your belt you will develop a template report and presentation that you or your staff if someday you decide to staff up, can use to do the assessment. Since each project is different this template will only function as a basic guide giving structure to your report.

If you are interested email me and I can send you the templated strategic assessments we use at my consultancy.

## Do I always do a discovery:
The truth is no, not always. There are a couple of exceptions where I wouldn’t recommend it. If your services are extremely standardized and there is not a huge variety of difference from one project to the next a discovery is not necessary. An example might be if you are a masseuse and you offer standard 1hr, 4hr, etc packages; then you probably don’t need to do a discovery.

I do strongly recommend having a few services that are well packaged but I will save the details on how to do that for another post.

## The End of the story:

Years later after I had implemented the strategic assessment policy and stopped doing discovery for free I got a call from that marketing agency in Chicago that used to window shop me. They asked for help on a project they were behind schedule on and wanted me to take a look and put together an estimate. I’ll admit there definitely was a sense of satisfaction when I told them I would be happy to take a look, the cost would be my typical Strategic Assessment plus rush job fees. I never did hear back from them, but again I didn’t really want to work with a company that would window shop me in the first place.

Your time is worth the value that you put on it. Don’t let others take advantage of you. The flip side to that is if you do charge for discovery make sure you are delivering the value the client expects and then some.
